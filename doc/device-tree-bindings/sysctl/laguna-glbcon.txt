Generic SYSCON mapped register subsysctl driver

This is a generic subsysctl driver using syscon to map the subsysctl register.
The subsysctl is generally performed with a write to the subsysctl register
defined by the register map pointed by syscon reference plus the offset and
shifted by the subsysctl specifier.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "axera,laguna-sysctl"
- #syscon-cells: at least 2
- regmap: this is phandle to the register map node
- offset: offset in the register map for the syscon register (in bytes)

Optional properties:
- mask: accept only the syscon specifiers defined by the mask (32 bit)
- field-width: bit width of field to write when asserting a syscon.

Default will be little endian mode, 32 bit access only.

Example:

		periph_glb: periph-glb@0E000000 {
			compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
			reg = <0x00 0x0E000000 0x00 0x1000>;

			uart_xfer_sel: uart-xfer-sel {
				compatible = "axera,laguna-sysctl";
				#syscon-cells = <2>;
				regmap = <&periph_glb>;
				offset = <0x2C>;
				mask = <0x3FF>;
				field-width = <2>;
				u-boot,dm-pre-reloc;
				u-boot,dm-spl;
			};
		};
